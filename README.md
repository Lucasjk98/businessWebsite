## Project Overview
This is the first project of the University of Santa Barbara bootcamp where I am to create an information-based website for a freelance professional or a business - either real or fictitious. The main purpose of this project is to practice basic static site creation skills. For this first project I have created a website for a local Taekwondo instructor that includes:
-an about page with information on the instructor and class offering
-a gallery of some photos from these classes
-a contact form to request a free introductory class 

## User Stories
- Exploring the Classes

As a prospective student interested in joining the local taekwondo studio, I want to visit the site's home page to quickly understand the offerings, philosophy, and ambiance of the studio. I expect to find a clear call-to-action button that directs me to the "About" page for more details about the classes and the experienced instructor.

- Learning about the Instructor

  
 As a curious visitor to the taekwondo studio's website, I want to navigate to the "About" page to learn more about the instructor's background, experience, and teaching philosophy. I expect to find a well-organized page with details about the instructor's credentials, achievements, and the benefits of participating in the classes.

- Engaging with the Studio's Community
  
 As a current or potential student, I want to explore the "Gallery" page on the taekwondo studio's site to view photos showcasing the studio environment, training sessions, and tournament participation. I expect the gallery to provide a visual representation of the studio's community, achievements, and the camaraderie among students. Additionally, I'd like the option to contact the studio for more information or to sign up for a free introductory class directly from the "Contact" page.


## Ideas for Future Improvement
- saving the submitted contact information in a database
- send automated email for submitting contact information or a calendar to choose a date for the introductory class
- more pictures in the gallery section
- an improved home page that maybe incorporates an api to have links to articles about martial arts
